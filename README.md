## ✦ Design Philosophy

> *"Every pixel should sound as good as the music."*

- **Dark-first aesthetic** — Deep blacks with warm orange (`#FF6B00`) and violet accents
- **Glassmorphism** — Frosted glass cards with subtle backdrop blur
- **Micro-animations** — Smooth hover transitions, scale effects, and opacity fades
- **Premium typography** — Outfit font family for a modern, clean feel
- **Consistent spacing** — 8px grid system throughout

<br/>

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/nauticstudio/nauticstudio.xyz.git

# Open in browser

# Or serve locally (recommended for SoundCloud API)
